# TASK--2
Exploratory Data Analysis

## Objective :
 The goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize insights.

## Tools Used :
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn

## Steps Followed :
1. Loaded the dataset using 'Pandas'.
2. Checked missing values and data types.
3. Created basic plots: histogram, boxplot, and countplots.
4. Analyzed survival patterns by age, class, and gender.
5. Visualize correlations between numeric columns.

## Key Insights :
 - Females and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates.
 - Fare is highly Skewed ( a few paid a lot more).
 - Age and Cabin columns have missing values.

## How to Run :
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn python eda_titanic.py
